# Rationale for manual tracking of pages
Note that there is a file, Writings-map.js which manually keeps track of which items at http://reference.bahai.org have corresponding wiki pages. Although the code ought to have been more maintainable if we were to make HTTP HEAD requests or use the Mediawiki API to detect whether a page had been created or not, this would have added undue burdens on the servers, especially when the finite number of pages (at least till now!) could easily be tracked. But this does periodically require updates since we have not created and cannot or do not wish to create stub pages on all of the wikis when the content is not yet ready.

# Todos
1. We might add links for Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi, etc. at the top of their pages.
